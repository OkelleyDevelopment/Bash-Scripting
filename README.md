# Bash Scripting Basics

## Motivation

Having moved most of my development life and slowly more of my everyday
computing needs to Linux, I wanted to be able to write scripts that
automate various installs for tools and configurations such as my:

- [Nvim-Config](https://github.com/OkelleyDevelopment/Nvim-Configs)

Or the more recently created,

- [Odinvim](https://github.com/OkelleyDevelopment/Odinvim)
  
Therefore, we have this Bash-Scripting repo!

## Disclaimer

Some of these scripts were written as purely toy programs and should only
be run at your discretion. I provide no assurance that things won't go wonky;
this is a learning repo afterall. :)
