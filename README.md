# Bash Scripting Basics

## Motivation

Having moved most of my development life and slowly more of my everyday
computing needs to Linux, I want to be able to write scripts that install
my default tools needed for my [neovim config](https://github.com/OkelleyDevelopment/Nvim-Configs). 
  
In order to continue with that goal, I must first understand the language which dictates 
how these operations are completed. THerefore, we have this Bash-Scripting repo!
